  position: AERODYNAMICS SOFTWARE ENGINEER
  description: |
    The aerodynamics software team at Mercedes is a small department, and as such I have significantly enhanced the software development capability. I have been involved in maintaining & re-architecting legacy (VC++ MFC) systems; as well as leading the charge to moderning (C# .NET) this older tech stack. I helped intoduce good unit testing & mocking practices. More recently I have been involed in a further push for modernisation by leveraging my existing skills to develop an Andoid app (Xamarin, .NET Core Web API).

    I am responsible for the full production stack, including requirements gathering, testing, deployment, database deployments, and keeping close relationships with client and business needs, as well as working with other teams in the business for cross-department projects. I have contributed to deployments on highly critial systems, such as those running on trackside infrastructure. My introduction to the team also allowed increased capability for fringe projects, such as a custom STL file clash checker and introducing besoke integration with CAD software & MS Office.
  list: 
    - New systems in C# (.NET Core/Framework, EntityFramework, NHibernate, DevExpress)
    - Maintenance & Feature development on large VC++ MFC application
